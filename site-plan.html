      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I plan to create a website that gives tips and such for staying safe on the computer. It will have pages for different subjects, terminology, and steps to take to avoid certain scams and malware. If one finds themself in a scam or attacked by malware, it will also tell them how to get out of it or get rid of it. Additionally, it will provide different ways to use the computer, how to use certain applications, and how to find out what applications are good or bad.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website will be for people who aren't familiar with computers, or aren't sure how to stay safe with their computers.</p>

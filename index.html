                <p class="paragraph">
                    File Explorer is the application used the most aside from the internet browser. Think of the File Explorer as a large filing cabinet, but it's all stored in this computer! File Explorer is a powerful tool that helps you manage your files and folders, making it easier to find, organize, and access them. In this section, we will walk you through the basics of File Explorer, starting from opening the application to navigating through folders.

                    Step 1: Opening File Explorer
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Look at the bottom of your screen. You will see a long bar with a few icons and a search bar, called the taskbar. The taskbar has the date and time at the far-right side, and the Windows logo at the far-left side. We will discuss what the Windows button does after this tutorial. Move your cursor to the taskbar, using your mouse or trackpad. Click on the File Explorer icon on the taskbar. The File Explorer icon looks like a light yellow folder.

                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After clicking on the File Explorer icon, a new window will appear on your screen. This is the File Explorer window. Inside the window, you will see a list of folders and files. The left side of the window is the navigation pane, where you can see different locations on your computer, such as This PC, Downloads, Documents, and Network. On the right side of the window is the main area, where you will see the contents of the currently selected folder or drive (a drive is a library for computers).

                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In the navigation pane on the left side of the File Explorer window, you will find a list of locations. There's a list on the navigation pane, above "This PC." This is called the Quick Access menu, where it shows folders pinned to the navigation pane (Quick Access folders with have an icon of a thumbtack beside the name of the folder). To navigate to a specific location, such as your Documents folder, click on the "Quick Access" section in the navigation pane. Within "Quick Access," click on the "Documents" folder. The main area of the File Explorer window will now display the contents of your "Documents" folder.

                    Step 4: Opening Files and Folders
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Inside the "Documents" folder, you will see a list of files and folders. To open a file or folder, simply double-click (click twice in rapid succession) on it. For example, if there's a file named "MyDocument.docx," double-click on it to open the document using the default program.

                    Step 5: Creating a New Folder and Renaming a Folder
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    To create a new folder within the current location, click the right button of your mouse or trackpad. A small list menu will pop up, and there will be a part of the menu labeled "New." When hovering your cursor over the button, there will be another small menu, and the top option in that submenu will be "Folder". This will create a new folder with a default name, such as "New Folder." The text should be highlighted blue, waiting for you to type in a name. If the name is wrong or needs to be changed, rename the folder by right-clicking on it, selecting "Rename," (in Windows 11, it's represented by an icon of a box with an A on the side of it) and typing in a new name of your choice.

                    Step 6: Navigating Back and Forth
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If you want to go back to the previous location you were in, click on the "Back" arrow located in the upper-left corner of the File Explorer window. To move forward to the next location (after going back), click on the "Forward" arrow next to the "Back" arrow.

                    Step 7: Closing File Explorer
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Once you are done using File Explorer, you can close it by clicking on the "X" button in the top-right corner of the window. This button will most likely turn red when your cursor hovers over it.
